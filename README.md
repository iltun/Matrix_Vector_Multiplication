# Matrix_Vector_Multiplication

This File contains vector-martix and matrix-matrix multiplications.

First lets have look to our code snippet.

In the first function I applied vector matrix multplication. Firstly, I created an empty list for results. Later, I put 0 for the sum_product value. Secondly, I created a loop which will calculate the product of matrix and vector. After finding values of sum_product it will append it to the list.

Second I created Matrix multiplication function for finding the product of two matrices. I created an empty list and after each operation program will append the result to the empty list.

Third is about input parts. You can uncomment for the execution of what would you like to do. While you choose you will add numbers based on rows and columns. If you choose matrix multiplication you need to add 2 matrices. If not, you have to add 1 vector and 1 matrix for the multilication proccess. In this example I choose matrix multiplication and I did add 2 matrices. First I have to choose the size of matrices. After that program will execute the answer of the multiplication of matrices.
