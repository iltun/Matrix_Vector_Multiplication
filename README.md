# Matrix_Vector_Multiplication

This File contains vector-martix and matrix-matrix multiplications.

First lets have look to our code snippet.

In the first function I applied vector matrix multplication. Firstly, I created an empty list for results. Later, I put 0 for the sum_product value. Secondly, I created a loop which will calculate the product of matrix and vector. After finding values of sum_product it will append it to the list.

Second I created Matrix multiplication function for finding the product of two matrices. I created an empty list and after each operation program will append the result to the empty list.
